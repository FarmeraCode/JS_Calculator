# JS_Calculator
Hi! this is the code of a calculator. Here, I used HTML and CSS for styling and JavaScript for logics. This is one of my beginning projects and helped me to practice logics and styling. However, it is not responsive as I just practiced logics here and is perfect for a laptop screen to view.
